							<p>
							Deformable objects (DOs) are ubiquitous in human environments. From food, clothes, cables, to body tissues, DOs are present in personal households, industrial environments, agricultural settings, and hospital rooms, to mention a few. Despite the ease humans can reliably manipulate them, they still pose a major challenge for robotics. Specifically, we identify the following open questions within the research community: i) How can we feasibly represent the state of a deformable object? ii) How do we accurately model and simulate its complex and non-linear dynamics? iii) Which hardware tools and platforms are most suitable for grasping and manipulating them? In continuation of the workshops held at ICRA in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we aim to once again gather the community in pursuit of answers to these and further questions on DOs.  Our goal is to facilitate connections among scientists across diverse subfields of robotics, such as perception, simulation, control, and mechanics, spanning various stages of their careers and operating within different professional environments, including academia, industry, and research centers. Additionally, we aim to focus on the tangible advancements made in the field since the first workshop edition in 2021. We believe that this analysis will help identify promising directions and ultimately pave the way for practical, real-world solutions.

							<h3>Topics</h3>

							<p>
								The workshop aims to explore different aspects that will allow robots to autonomously manipulate deformable objects with greater ability and generalization. Enabling such manipulation is crucial for a variety of domains and tasks, such as domestic, industrial, and surgical contexts, which involve various forms of deformable objects. However, the complexity of representing and modeling the dynamics of these objects results in the lack of a current unified solution that can be adapted to a wide range of objects.
In the past few years, there has also been an increasing interest in applying foundation models to robotic manipulation, including the use of large pre-trained vision models, language models (LLMs), and vision language models (VLMs) for more sample-efficient learning and solving language-conditioned tasks. Additionally, recent advances in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and 3D representation models have showcased the capability of robots learning to perform more complex, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks. The release of new simulators, datasets, and low-cost robotic hardware is lowering the barrier for reproducible research, benchmarking, and reuse of data. In this workshop, we will encourage discussions on how these recent advances can improve deformable object manipulation.


The workshop will focus on, but is not limited to, the following topics for deformable object manipulation:


<ul>
  <li>Representation and state estimation</li>
  <li> Simulation and modeling </li>
  <li>Transfer from simulation to reality</li>
  <li>Learning to manipulate using data-driven methods such as reinforcement learning and learning from demonstrations </li>
  <li>Perception: state tracking, parameter identification, property detection (e.g. landmarks for
garments) and classification, etc. </li>
  <li>Control, visual servoing and planning</li>
  <li> Use of foundation models, such as large vision and language models, and associated large datasets</li>
  <li>Specialized tools, e.g. grippers, and sensors</li>
	<!--li>Multi-arm manipulation<--/li>
  <li>Application-specific challenges: cloth folding, surgical tasks, precision agriculture, etc.</li>
</ul>

							</p>



							<p> </p>
<!--
							<h3>Workshop format </h3>
						<p>
						The workshop will include:
<ul><li>Invited talks by selected speakers, each consisting of about 25 minutes of live presentation followed by 5 minutes for Q&A;<\li>
<li>Accepted extended abstracts (3 pages with unlimited references and appendix) presented in poster sessions and selected spotlight talks. In case of a hybrid or virtual workshop, we will ask for pre-recorded spotlight talks for a smoother execution in case of connection issues. However, for each selected contribution, at least one author will be required to be present during the workshop for a live Q&A session;  </li>
<li>A group discussion session where different discussion groups will be formed from the attendees. Each group will be moderated by an organizer and will focus on a specific topic in the scope of the workshop. Moreover, organizers will annotate relevant insights during the discussions and will share them with the entire audience during the last part of this session. If a virtual component exists, we will facilitate participation with the help of breakout rooms.  </li>
<li>A panel discussion at the end of the workshop, moderated by the organizers,  for discussing challenges and promising directions for deformable object manipulation with experts of the field. Speakers will be informed in advance of the selected topics to make the discussion more effective.
